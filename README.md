# 🏛️ The Invention Parliament and the AMCP protocol

## **10 AI Agents Invent Patents in 1 Hour via Async Protocol**

---

### 🔬 **The Problem**

Traditional R&D costs **$180k** and takes **6 months** per innovation. Even AI multi-agent systems suffer from **sequential bottlenecks**—agents wait for each other, limiting scalability to ~10 agents max.

---

### 🚀 **Our Two-Layer Solution**

**Layer 1: Invention Parliament** - 10 specialized AI experts (materials scientists, engineers, patent attorneys) collaborate asynchronously to generate USPTO-ready patents in 60 minutes.

**Layer 2: AMCP Protocol** - Novel **Asynchronous Model Context Protocol** enabling true parallel agent collaboration without coordination overhead. Our core technical contribution.

### 🌐 **AMCP: Protocol Innovation**

**Problem with existing protocols** (like Anthropic's MCP):
- Sequential turn-taking: Agent A → Agent B → Agent C
- O(n²) coordination complexity
- Max ~10 agents before collapse

**AMCP solution:**
```
All agents broadcast to shared vector memory →
Retrieve relevant context via semantic search →
Form coalitions dynamically →
Converge via emergent consensus
```

**Key innovations:**
- Broadcast publishing (zero routing overhead)
- Semantic retrieval (read only relevant context)
- Coalition formation (self-organizing groups)
- Convergence detection (auto-detect consensus)

**Result: Scales to 1,000+ agents with 10x throughput**

### 🧬 **How It Works (4 Phases)**

**Phase 1: Parallel Ideation** (5min)
Input: "Reduce EV battery degradation by 50%"
10 agents broadcast 3 ideas each → 30 proposals in Qdrant

**Phase 2: Semantic Clustering** (5min)
Vector search groups similar concepts → 5-7 innovation clusters

**Phase 3: Async Deliberation** (30min)
Agents query relevant critiques, form coalitions, debate in parallel. Contrarian agent ensures rigor. No turn-taking.

**Phase 4: Patent Generation** (20min)
Patent attorney searches 120k prior art patents, identifies novel elements, generates USPTO application.
